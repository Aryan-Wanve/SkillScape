Problem Statement:  
Graduates lack the industry-specific skills needed to be job-ready, while industries struggle to find suitable talent due to outdated academic curricula and insufficient experiential learning opportunities.

Solution:  
"SkillSync" bridges the gap between academia and industry by providing a platform where students gain real-world skills, institutions align their curricula with dynamic industry needs, and employers find ready-to-hire talent. It combines experiential learning, technology, and collaboration to prepare students for the future workforce.
